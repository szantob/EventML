# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

`eventml-core` (the metamodel) and `eventml-lib` (the domain vocabulary) are
versioned separately. Entries state which one changed.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-08

First release. A specification only: prose and data, nothing executable.

### Added — eventml-core 0.1.0

- **Four modelling layers** (`spec/01-layers.md`): L0 Brief, L1 Requirement, L2 Logical, L3 Physical,
  each with what belongs in it, what does not, and three boundary rules.
- **Ten core entities** (`spec/02-metamodel.md`): the `def`/`usage` split taken from SysML v2, with
  `ItemDef`, `PortDef`, `PartDef`, `InterfaceDef`, `RequirementDef` and `ConstraintDef` as definitions,
  and `Part`, `Connection`, `Flow` and `Requirement` as usages. Each documented with a complete attribute
  table and a worked example. Includes the two rules the model cannot work without: `Connection` and
  `Flow` are separate entities, and `PartDef` carries internal traversability.
- **Five traceability relations** (`spec/03-relationships.md`): `refine`, `derive`, `satisfy`,
  `allocate`, `trace`, with cardinalities and the meaning of an absent edge.
- **The uncertainty model** (`spec/04-uncertainty.md`): progressive wrapping, the five value states
  (`stated`, `derived`, `assumed`, `unknown`, `conflicting`), the five question rules, and the ranking
  by how many requirements each open point blocks.
- **Canonical YAML syntax** (`spec/05-concrete-syntax.md`): file layout, two-document headers, catalogue
  and instance identifier formats, and the four reference forms.
- **SysML v2 mapping** (`spec/06-sysml-mapping.md`): all ten entities and five relations mapped, with a
  side-by-side translation and an account of what does not survive the round trip.

### Added — eventml-lib 0.1.0

- Base vocabulary for five domains — audio, power, network, video, lighting — as 172 catalogue entries:
  signal and power items, port and interface definitions, abstract L2 blocks, concrete L3 part
  categories, requirement templates with client-language questions, and computable constraints.
- Three worked models under `examples/`, spanning 112 parts and 170 connections:
  - **01 garden party** — outdoor event, audio and power, all five value states, question rules 1–4
  - **02 conference room** — hybrid corporate event, video, network and lighting, the `derive` relation,
    two flows sharing one connection, question rule 5
  - **03 festival stage** — generator-powered outdoor stage, all five domains, a flow changing medium
    three times, partial redundancy stated as partial, and power over a data connection
- Hungarian glossary (`docs/glossary-hu.md`) covering every metamodel, layer, relation and domain term,
  recording where the Hungarian trade uses the English word unchanged.

### Verification

v0.1 has no validator, so the examples carry the verification burden. Both rules from the design record
§7 were run before tagging:

- **Every defined concept appears in at least one example: 172 of 172.** Enforcing this produced example
  03 and found four defects in the domain library — ten `PortDef`s attached to no `PartDef`, missing
  audio inputs and a missing network port on the video processing parts, and no part able to feed a
  system processor over AES3. All fixed.
- **Every example is walkable across all four layers.** All catalogue references, port references, flow
  routes and allocations resolve.

Three requirements across the three examples have no upward trace, and six have an empty `satisfied_by`.
These are deliberate and are the language working as designed: a requirement from professional judgement
has no client statement to refine, and an unsatisfied requirement is question rule 3 firing. Each is
annotated in place.

### Not in this release

No machine-readable schema, no validator, no question-list derivation, no diagram generation, no Claude
skill, no Rentman or Odoo binding. The question lists in the examples are hand-written to demonstrate the
intended output. Formalising the metamodel is the first task of v0.2.
